                <p class="description">In the Twitch homepage, there is a clear hierarchy when 
                    displaying the videos. The main live video is at the top, the second 
                    most important are down the page in a smaller format, and there is even a third row of 
                    videos with an even smaller size under those. The rest of the information is displayed
                    a lot smaller, so that the user can easily identify what they are looking for right away
                    (the trending videos).

                <p class="description">This website is so full of options that it would be 
                    very hard to choose what to watch if not for its filters. The browser section is
                    divided into genres and type of media, but if that's still not good enough, there is 
                    a dropdown menu with all the different sections put in a list. So once the user 
                    decides the genre, the media options are greatly reduced and therefore, the choice 
                    is simpler.

                <p class="description">Google's website has many examples of different ways to apply alignment.
                    It is recognizable in the top menu, where all the text is located in the same virtual line,
                    the videos that appear from the search are all of the same size, with images and text that 
                    start at the same heights, one next to the other. The last section shows vertical alignment.
